:wave: **Hey everyone and welcome to This Week in Lotus!**

The [third release candidate for Lotus v1.17.1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.17.1-rc3) was published this week and are currently going through extensive testing. The [SPX group is especially testing the new SplitStoreV2](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/9179), which can be run in `universal`, `discard` and now `AutoPrune` modes. They will be collecting storage metrics over a period of 4 weeks to show differences between each setting.

The full documentation :book: for **SplitStoreV2** is currently in review, and will be published soon.

:rocket: **Upcoming features/enhancements:**
- The option to only extend CC-sectors with the lotus-miner sectors renew command has been reviewed and merged this week.
- Work towards supporting multiple chain nodes per storage provider progressed nicely this week. Adding a UUID to messages sent by the storage provider to the lotus daemon has been merged, and a PR for retrying pushing messages to the message pool in case of unavailability of a lotus chain node is currently in review.
- Enabling Sealing-as-a-Service is a priority this quarter, and we made some progress towards that goal this week. A draft for managing sector number assignment between a potential service and the lotus-miner was published.

:bug: **Bugfixes:**
- A UX-fix to exclude negative available balance from spendable amount if a storage provider was in debt was merged yesterday.

**Protocol development:**
- The team has been actively engaging on a `Decoupling FIL+ from markets FIP-proposal` draft this week. Suggested order of :eyes: is starting [with the summary](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/313#discussion-3919528), then read the [current draft](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/pull/432/files) FIP. If you have questions and feedbacks, it [can be posted here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/313).
- We will start working on the accepted [FIP0034](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0034.md) - `Fix pre-commit deposit independent of sector content` which is scheduled to be included in the nv17 upgrade.

**Lotus community:**
- The Lotus team will be at both [FIL Singapore](https://fil.org/events/fil-singapore) and [FIL Lisbon](https://hub.fil.org/fil-lisbon) where we will host a **Lotus & friends day (registration opening soon, stay tuned)**. We hope to see many of you there :smile:.
- :mega: The authors of the FIP0036 are looking for more [feedback from Lotus-users](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/421), and especially want them to check out the [SP return calculator](https://observablehq.com/@starboard/sproi-fip-duration-v2).

Thatâ€™s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
