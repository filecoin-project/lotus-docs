The [fourth release candidate](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.18.0-rc4) of the upcoming mandator release of Lotus that introduces [Filecoin network v17, codenamed the Shark upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=top#discussioncomment-3825422) was released this week. **The final release of v1.18.0 will be out mid next week.**

:shark: **Upgrade:**
- The Calibration network migrated successfully to Network version 17 yesterday and we will continue to monitor and test the network.
- The upgrade date for mainnet is set to `2022-11-09`, the exact epoch will be announced later.
- The Shark Upgrade includes FIP0045, which brings a lot new changes for both clients and storage providers. Please check out the [FIP0045 Explainer video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UaFN-w_OzM) to understand how it impacts you.

:microscope: **LabWeek22:**
- The Protocol Labs Network is gathering the next week and we will spend the time to collaborate, plan and align on a variety of topics with the other teams. The Lotus team will still be around on Slack, but we will be less responsive at times.

:flag-pt: **Lotus, Data onboarding and Friends day**
- We are really looking forward to seeing everybody that has signed up at the event, and we are getting close to a sold out event!! A ticket is needed to attend [so grab yours today while they are still available](https://pretix.eu/solaris/lotus-data-onboarding-friends-summit/)!

Thatâ€™s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
