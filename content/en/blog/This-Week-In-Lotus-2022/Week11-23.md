:rocket: **FEVM launch**

The Filecoin network upgraded successfully to network version 18 this week, and we have seen a handful of contracts being deployed and used already :tada:

There have been a lot of FEVM-related questions this week, so here is some documentation for the most typical questions we have seen around:

- [How do I add Filecoin to MetaMask?](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/wallets/metamask/#add-to-metamask)
- [How can I send FIL from a ETH-style account to a Filecoin-style address?](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/wallets/filforwader/)
- [How can I get my Filecoin address from an ETH address?](https://beryx.zondax.ch/address_converter)
   - In Lotus you can use the lotus evm stat <ETH-addrs> command.

In Lotus, most FEVM-related commands can be found in the `lotus evm` command. Check out all the subcommands with `lotus evm -h`

We also have a couple of new ecosystem services and tooling that you might want to check out:
- [Glif explorer](https://explorer.glif.io/)
- [Beryx explorer](https://beryx.zondax.ch/)
- [Ankr - node service provider with ETH APIs](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/filecoin/)
- [Glif - node service provider with ETH APIs](https://hosting.glif.io/)

**Network version 19**
With the network version 18 behind us, we will start looking towards the network version 19 upgrade, which will be a lighter-weight network upgrade. You can see the FIP tracking table for the [network version here.](https://filecoin.notion.site/nv19-Governance-DRI-FIPs-Tracking-Table-183c9ea033c547b39fc4c422174d4531)

That’s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
