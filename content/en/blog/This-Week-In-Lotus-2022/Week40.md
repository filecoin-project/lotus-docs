The **stable release of Lotus v1.17.2** is now out :tada: This feature release introduces the sector number management APIs in Lotus that enables all the Sealing-as-a-Service and Lotus interactions needed to function. Deep dive into the new APIs here: [#9079 (comment)](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/9079#discussioncomment-3652044). This version also raises the default propagation delay to 10 seconds for storage providers, so from now on you will see `"baseDeltaSeconds": 10` as default in your `lotus-miner` logs.

The release has numerous other enhancements and bug fixes, so make sure to [check out the full release notes here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.17.2).

:warning: Please note that Lotus v1.17.2 will require a Go-version of v1.18.1 or higher!

:rocket: **Features / Enhancements:**
- A pull request to [add the uptime of your lotus daemon](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9436) to the `lotus info` command has been opened, and is currently in review.
- We are currently testing the `redundant chain nodes feature`, and will test it over the next couple of weeks/month. If you feel adventurous and want to play with the feature early, [here is a guide to how you can set it up in a local developer network](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/9449).

**Protocol development:**
- A [second release candidate for builtin-actors v9.0.0](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/releases/tag/v9.0.0-rc.2) was released this week. We currently integrating the remaining work items of Network 17 into Lotus.
- Network version 17 is now deployed to the Butterfly network :butterfly: The network will most likely be reset multiple times as we test out different network upgrade test cases.
