The Protocol Labs Network has been gathering in Lisbon this week for **LabWeek22** :microscope:. We have been able to spend a lot of time to collaborate, plan and align on a variety of topics with other teams, and are looking forward to share more of the work done and future plans in the coming weeks. A lot of the presentations where live streamed and recorded, so you should be available to view these soon.

:flag-pt: **Lotus, Data onboarding and Friends day**
- It´s only four days until [Lotus, Data onboarding and friends](https://pretix.eu/solaris/lotus-data-onboarding-friends-summit/) day on the 2nd of November. We have an impressive lineup of speakers and are looking forward to seeing everybody there.

Also, a big shoutout :loudspeaker: to the Filecoin Saturn Network :ringed_planet:, a content delivery network (CDN) built on Filecoin which launched this week. Join the #filecoin-saturn in Slack and check out [https://strn.network/](https://strn.network/) for more information about how you can join the network.

That’s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
