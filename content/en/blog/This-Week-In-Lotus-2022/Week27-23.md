:wave: **Hey everyone and welcome to This Week in Lotus!**

**v1.23.3-rc1:**

The first release candidate for v1.23.3 was released this week. It includes numerous improvements and enhancements for node operators, ETH RPC-providers and storage providers. Some of the feature highlights are:

- The Ethereum-like RPC exposed by Lotus is [now compatible with EIP-1898.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/10921)
- The PieceReader-code in `lotus-miner` [now supports parallel reads](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/10913), which should significantly speed up retrievals of smaller pieces of data.
- Node operators are now able to configure execution trace cache size with the `LOTUS_EXEC_TRACE_CACHE_SIZE` [environment-variable.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/10585)
- ++ a lot of bug fixes and CLI UX-enhancements.

Check out [the full changelog here.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/0c5400f7f671a0f6392bd93165ac8ed13d82a705/CHANGELOG.md)

**NB:** exclamation: We discovered an issue where node operators running with the `EnableEthRPC=true` setting have their daemons APIs blocked coming alive due to a long running migration, [further information about the underlying issue can be read here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/11015#issuecomment-1623983558). We expect to have a fix for this issue in the next release candidate.
-  :white_check_mark: SPs and node-operators running with `EnableEthRPC=false` is not impacted by this, and are able to start their nodes without issues.

:runner: **Sprint-item board:**

We often hear from the community that it can be difficult to keep track of the projects and tickets that the Lotus team is engaged in on a week-to-week basis and what the progress of various tasks/issues are. To start addressing this, we have opened our FilCat :cat: GH-project board. This board will display the specific tasks that the team is focusing on during each sprint, making it easier to monitor their status and progress.

We will continue to add our backlog into this board over the coming weeks/months to give it a more full-view of items we are working on. [Check out the FilCat project board here.](https://github.com/orgs/filecoin-project/projects/92)

:bar_chart: **State usage visualization:**

As stated earlier, one of our milestones in Q3 is to better understand the Filecoin state byte size, and creating tools that allows us to monitor their growth over time.

We have an early display of the state byte sizes already, check out the [state data breakdown of a recent snapshot here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaK2mZRk2M2g3wT4nVgPd8Sh4bb1w7aNKUmxLqv4zZnAx). You can follow what the [next steps for this state summary here.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/11022)

That’s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
