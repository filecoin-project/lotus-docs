## Problem

When running `lotus-miner auth create-token --perm admin` the following error occures (could happen with any lotus-miner commands). 

```plaintext
ERROR: could not get API info for StorageMiner: repo directory does not exist. Make sure your configuration is correct
```

## Environment

- Mainnet 
- Calibnet
- Devnet

## Resolution

The miner cannot find the .lotusminer path. The env variable `LOTUS_MINER_PATH` needs to be set in the active terminal.
