## Problem:

An alert, similar to the following, shows up in lotus or lotus-miner.

`active process:fd-limit last raised at 2021-12-09 16:30:39.901 +0800 +08; reason: {"message":"soft FD limit is low","recommended_min":100000,"soft_limit":16384}`

Note that this error is an example from Ubuntu, but would be similar in other OS variants. 

## Environment:

* Mainnet
* Calibnet
* Devnet

## Resolution:

This will be host OS specific, but it should be similar on all OS types. Below is the example from Ubuntu. You will also have to reboot.
```
sudo echo "* soft nofile 256000" >> /etc/security/limits.conf
sudo echo "* hard nofile 512000"Â >> /etc/security/limits.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```
Values of the above resolution (the big number) may vary.
