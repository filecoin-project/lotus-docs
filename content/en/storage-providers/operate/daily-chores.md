## Inspect expiring sectors

The `check-expire` lets you inspect which sectors are about to expire. By default it will display the sectors that will expire within 60 days:

```shell
lotus-miner sectors check-expire
```

If you want to display sectors that will expire later, or earlier, then 60 days from now, you can change the `--cutoff` option with your desired epoch length cutoff.

```shell with-output
lotus-miner sectors check-expire --cutoff 345600
```

```shell output

### Extend sectors

You can extend a sector with the command:

```shell
lotus-miner sectors renew [command options] [arguments...]
```

This is an example of selecting sectors with a lifecycle between `epochnumber-a` epoch and `epochnumber-b` epoch and updating it to 1555200 epoch:

```shell
lotus-miner sectors renew  --from <epochnumber-a> --to <epochnumber-b> --new-expiration 1555200
```

This is an example of updating the lifecycle of a sector read from a file to 1555200 epoch:

```shell
lotus-miner sectors renew  --sector-file <your-sectorfile> --new-expiration 1555200
```

{{< alert icon="warning" >}}
You have to select the sectors to renew. That means you have to specify the `--from` and `--to` option, or specify the sector file, if no sector is selected this command will have no effect.

Format of sector file:

```
1
2
...
```
{{< /alert >}}

## Compacting partitions

Expired, removed and terminated sectors will be listed in your proving partition until you compact your partitions. To clean up a partition in a deadline we can use the `lotus-miner sectors compact-partitions` command. The network enforces a security measure that disallows compacting a partition in a deadline untill 1800 epochs (15 hours) have passed. This is to enforce that compacting a deadline cannot be used to prevent invalid posts from being disputed.

The `lotus-miner sectors compact-partitions` also includes a safety measure that disallows compacting during a challenge window, or the prior challenge window. This is because compaction rearranges metadata, and if done too close to a windowPoSt it could cause you to miss a windowPost.

It is recommended to compact your partitions on a regular basis as it will save gas fees. All computations are captured and accounted for by the FVM, this includes the bitfield computation. If you have "dead‚Äù sectors stored in your `lotus-miner` actor state, every read/write to your sectors info will result in wasted computations leading to higher gas costs.

You can inspect which sectors and the partition index in a proving deadline with `lotus-miner proving deadline <deadlineIdx>`.

```shell output
lotus-miner proving deadline 1
Deadline Index:           1
Partitions:               1
Proven Partitions:        0
Current:                  false

Partition Index:          0
Sectors:                  74

Faults:                   0
Faulty Sectors:           []
```

To compact a partition, you need to specify the deadline and the partition index `lotus-miner sectors compact-partitions --deadline <Proving-Deadline> --partitions <Partition-Index>`.

```shell output
lotus-miner sectors compact-partitions --deadline 1 --partitions 0 --really-do-it
compacting 1 paritions
Requested compact partitions in message bafy2bzacecnmiea6y7yt776vhur5rdjgliw5cvlb7cuf4q643ntu44odjgh64
```

After the compaction message has been sent, you should be able to see that your proving deadline has been compacted and old sectors has been removed:

```shell output
lotus-miner proving deadline 1
Deadline Index:           1
Partitions:               1
