The are two types of upgrades: 

- The [upgrade in-place](#upgrade-in-place) is the default procedure and just updates the software
- The [upgrade with reset](#upgrade-with-reset) removes all the data and starts from scratch.

## Cross-check your config file

All upgrade types require you to double-check that your configuration files are up-to-date. You can do this by exporting the default configuration files from Lotus and comparing them to your configuration files.

To export the default configuration files from Lotus, run:

```shell
lotus-miner config default
```

This will output something like:

```toml
[API]
  # Binding address for the Lotus API
  #
  # type: string
  # env var: LOTUS_API_LISTENADDRESS
  #ListenAddress = "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/2345/http"

...
```

If you would prefer to have Lotus export the default configuration to a file, run:

```shell
lotus-miner config default >> ~/default-lotus-miner-configuration.toml
```

Once you have the default configuration file, compare it with your configuration file and make sure that you're not missing any sections. See the [Lotus release notes](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases) for details on what new sections have been added.

## Upgrade in-place

1. Safely shutdown your Lotus Miner as explained [here]({{< relref "maintenance" >}}).
1. Shutdown any seal workers
1. Shutdown your Lotus Node (`lotus daemon stop` or `systemctl stop lotus-daemon`)
1. Pull the new version and rebuild. For more information read the [Lotus installation guide]({{< relref "../../lotus/install/prerequisites" >}}) again:

```shell
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -g"
export FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1
git pull
git checkout <tag_or_branch>
git submodule update
make clean
make all
make install
```

1. Start the Lotus daemon and wait for sync:

```shell
lotus daemon
# or when using systemctl
systemctl start lotus-daemon
```

```shell
lotus sync wait
```

2. Start your miner and your workers

```shell
lotus-miner run
```

```shell
lotus-worker run
```

## Upgrade with reset

{{< alert icon="warning" >}}
This upgrade procedure should only be used as a last resort or when the chain has been upgraded and requires such action to be taken.
{{< /alert >}}

It is similar to re-installing everything from scratch, so you can follow the usual [installation]({{< relref "../../lotus/install/prerequisites" >}}) and [miner-setup]({{< relref "initialize" >}}) guides after it. Before you do this, consider:

- [Backing up your Lotus wallets]({{< relref "manage-fil#exporting-and-importing-addresses" >}})
- You may want to backup your Lotus Node and Miner configurations as well.

Once you are ready, stop everything and delete the data folders (or rename them):

```shell
# Assuming you are using the default data folders
rm -rf ~/.lotus
rm -rf ~/.lotusminer
rm -rf ~/.lotusworker
```

After that Lotus applications will start from scratch.
