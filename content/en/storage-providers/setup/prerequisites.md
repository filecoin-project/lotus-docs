Mining will only work if you fully comply with the [minimal hardware requirements]({{< relref "hardware-requirements" >}}) for the network in which you will mine. The mining process is very resource-intensive and is dependent on precise configuration. We strongly recommend Linux systems administration experience before embarking.

## Neccessary prerequisites

These steps must be performed to sucessfully intialize a lotus miner.

### Basic Prerequisites

Please make sure that the following prerequites are met whether you are planning to run the lotus miner on the same machine as lotus daemon or a different machine.

1. Install the latest stable [Nvidia drivers and Cuda]({{< relref "../../tutorials/lotus-miner/cuda" >}}) if you have an Nvidia card on your machine. Nvidia cards have a better performance with Cuda when compared to OpenCL.
2. Make sure you have followed the instructions to [install the Lotus suite]({{< relref "../../lotus/install/prerequisites" >}}) to build the `lotus-miner` binary. Make sure that you have built Lotus with "Native Filecoin FFI" and exported the following variable to compile FFI to use Cuda if using Nvidia cards.

    ```shell
    export FFI_USE_CUDA=1
    ```

    Please do not use the `lotus-miner` binary created during Lotus node installation process as it does not include the above options.

3. Make sure your Lotus Node is running as the miner will communicate with it and cannot work otherwise.
4. If you are in China, read the [tips for running in China]({{< relref "../../lotus/install/prerequisites#node-in-china" >}}) page first.
5. Make sure to [add swap]({{< relref "../../kb/add-swap" >}}) to the machine as required.

### Running the miner on a different machine as the Lotus Node

If you opt to run a miner on a different machine as the Lotus Node, set:

```shell
export FULLNODE_API_INFO=<api_token>:/ip4/<lotus_daemon_ip>/tcp/<lotus_daemon_port>/http
```

Make sure the `ListenAddress` has [remote access enabled]({{< relref "../../developers/api-access#enable-remote-api-access" >}}). Instructions on how to obtain a token are [available here]({{< relref "api-access#obtaining-tokens" >}}).

### Performance tweaks

It is recommended to set the following environment variables in your environment so that they are defined every time any of the `lotus` daemons are launched:

```shell
# See https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/
export FIL_PROOFS_MAXIMIZE_CACHING=1 # More speed at RAM cost (1x sector-size of RAM - 32 GB).
export FIL_PROOFS_USE_GPU_COLUMN_BUILDER=1 # precommit2 GPU acceleration
export FIL_PROOFS_USE_GPU_TREE_BUILDER=1

# The following increases speed of PreCommit1 at the cost of using a full
# CPU Core-Complex rather than a single core. Should be used with CPU affinities set!
# See https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/ and the seal workers guide.
export FIL_PROOFS_USE_MULTICORE_SDR=1
```

### Cuda variables

There are some changes in the latest Nvidia driver, so if you upgrade your driver remember to check `nvidia-smi` - it will always display the correct name for the GPU. The new names are not picked by FFI automatically and need to be exported manually.

If you are using an nvidia driver below `460.91.03`

```shell
export BELLMAN_CUSTOM_GPU="GeForce RTX 3090:10496"
```

If you are using an Nvidia driver above `510.47.03`

```shell
export BELLMAN_CUSTOM_GPU="NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090:10496"
```

Nvidia RTX 3090 was used in this example. Remember to edit it with your GPU and amount of Cuda cores.

### Configure parameters location

For the miner to start, it will need to read and verify the Filecoin proof parameters. These can be downloaded in advance (recommended), or otherwise the init process will. Proof parameters consist of several files, which in the case of 32 GiB sectors, total **over 100 GiB**.

We recommend setting a custom location to store parameters and proofs parent cache -created during the first run- with:

```shell
export FIL_PROOFS_PARAMETER_CACHE=/path/to/folder/in/fast/disk
export FIL_PROOFS_PARENT_CACHE=/path/to/folder/in/fast/disk2
```

Parameters are read on every (re)start, so using disks with very fast access, like NVMe drives, will speed up miners and workers (re)boots. When the above variables are not set, things will end up in `/var/tmp/` by default, which **often lacks enough space**.

Parameters will be downloaded automatically when the miner is initiated. You can also [optionally download]({{< relref "#downloading-parameters" >}}) them before initializing.

### Creating wallets for the miner

You will need at least a BLS wallet (`f3...` for mainnet) for mining. We recommend using [separate owner and worker addresses]({{< relref "addresses" >}}):

```shell
# A new BLS address to use as owner address:
lotus wallet new bls
f3...

# A new BLS address to use as worker address:
lotus wallet new bls
f3...
```

{{< alert icon="callout" >}}
Next make sure to [send some funds]({{< relref "manage-fil" >}}) to the **worker address** so that the miner setup can be completed. The amount you should initialize with varies with gas fees, but 0.1 FIL is generally a safe amount. The sender doesn't have to be any particular address and can be specified using the `from` flag. If `from` is unspecified, the sender will default to the `owner` address, in which case the `onwer` must have the 0.1 FIL. If the `owner` is also unspecified, the wallet's default address is used as the owner and that address must have the 0.1 FIL.

For additional information about the different wallets that a miner can use and how to configure them, read the [miner addresses guide]({{< relref "addresses" >}}).

## Optional prerequisites

These prerequisites are optional and can be used on a case by case basis. Please make sure to understand the use case before performing these steps.

### Install extra dependencies

This step is only necessary if you are running an Nvidia GPU and would prefer to use OpenCL instead of CUDA. Please note that Cuda is recommended over OpenCL for sealing and proving workload. Most Linux distributions contain this package in their package manager:

```shell
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install -y nvidia-opencl-icd -y
```

### Optional Performance tweaks

```shell
# See https://github.com/filecoin-project/bellman
export BELLMAN_CPU_UTILIZATION=0.875
```

The `BELLMAN_CPU_UTILIZATION` is an optional variable to designate a proportion of the multi-exponentiation calculation to be moved to a CPU in parallel to the GPU. This is an effort to keep all the hardware occupied. The interval must be a number between `0` and `1`. The value `0.875` is a good starting point, but you should experiment with it if you want an optimal setting. Different hardware setups wil
l result in different values being optimal. Omitting this environment variable might also be optimal.

### Downloading parameters

To download the parameters do:

```shell
# Use sectors supported by the Filecoin network that the miner will join and use.
# lotus-miner fetch-params <sector-size>
lotus-miner fetch-params 32GiB
lotus-miner fetch-params 64GiB
```
