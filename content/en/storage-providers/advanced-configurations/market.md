## Dealmaking section

This section controls parameters for making storage and retrieval deals:

```toml
[Dealmaking]
  # When enabled, the miner can accept online deals
  ConsiderOnlineStorageDeals = true
  # When enabled, the miner can accept offline deals
  ConsiderOfflineStorageDeals = true
  # When enabled, the miner can accept retrieval deals
  ConsiderOnlineRetrievalDeals = true
  # When enabled, the miner can accept offline retrieval deals
  ConsiderOfflineRetrievalDeals = true
  # When enabled, the miner can accept verified deals
  ConsiderVerifiedStorageDeals = true
  # When enabled, the miner can accept unverified deals
  ConsiderUnverifiedStorageDeals = true
  # A list made of Data CIDs to reject when making deals
  PieceCidBlocklist = []
  # Maximum expected amount of time getting the deal into a sealed sector will take
  # This includes the time the deal will need to get transferred and published
  # before being assigned to a sector
  # for more info, see below.
  ExpectedSealDuration = "24h0m0s"
  # When a deal is ready to publish, the amount of time to wait for more
  # deals to be ready to publish before publishing them all as a batch
  PublishMsgPeriod = "1h0m0s"
  # The maximum number of deals to include in a single publish deals message
  MaxDealsPerPublishMsg = 8

  # A command used for fine-grained evaluation of storage deals (see below)
  Filter = "/absolute/path/to/storage_filter_program"

  # A command used for fine-grained evaluation of retrieval deals (see below)
  RetrievalFilter = "/absolute/path/to/retrieval_filter_program"
```

`ExpectedSealDuration` is an estimate of how long sealing will take and is used to reject deals whose start epoch might be earlier than the expected completion of sealing. It can be estimated by [benchmarking]({{< relref "benchmarks" >}}) or by [pledging a sector]({{< relref "sector-pledging" >}}).

{{< alert icon="warning" >}}
The final value of `ExpectedSealDuration` should equal `(TIME_TO_SEAL_A_SECTOR + WaitDealsDelay) * 1.5`. This equation ensures that the miner does not commit to having the sector sealed too soon.

`StartEpochSealingBuffer` allows `lotus-miner` to seal a sector before a certain epoch. For example: if the current epoch is 1000 and a deal within a sector must start on epoch 1500, then `lotus-miner` must wait until the current epoch is 1500 before it can start sealing that sector. However, if `lotus-miner` sets `StartEpochSealingBuffer` to 500, the `lotus-miner` can start sealing the sector at epoch 1000. 

If there are multiple deals in a sector, the deal with a start time closest to the current epoch is what `StartEpochSealingBuffer` will be based off. So, if the sector in our example has three deals that start on epoch 1000, 1200, and 1400, then we `lotus-miner` will start sealing the sector at epoch 500.

### Disabling new sector for deal

If `MakeNewSectorForDeals` is set to `true` then `lotus-miner` will create new sectors for incoming deals. This option can set to `false` to ensure that all new deals are sealed as snap-deals into CC sectors. This can help reduce the sealing time for the new deals as long as CC sectors are ready for the snap-deals.

### Make new CC sector available for snap-deal

`MakeCCSectorsAvailable` makes all the new CC sectors available to be upgraded with snap-deals. When this boolean is set to `true`, all pledged "CC" sectors from that point onwards will be converted to "Available" state after sealing. This enables sealing the incoming storage deals more quickly into these "Available" sectors compared to creating a new sector for the deals. 

### Publishing several deals in one message

The `PublishStorageDeals` message can publish multiple deals in a single message.
When a deal is ready to be published, Lotus will wait up to `PublishMsgPeriod`
for other deals to be ready before sending the `PublishStorageDeals` message.

However, once `MaxDealsPerPublishMsg` is ready, Lotus will immediately publish all the deals.

For example, if `PublishMsgPeriod` is 1 hour:

- At 1:00 pm, deal 1 is ready to publish. Lotus will wait until 2:00 pm for other deals to be ready before sending `PublishStorageDeals`.
- At 1:30 pm, Deal 2 is ready to publish
- At 1:45 pm, Deal 3 is ready to publish
- At 2:00pm, lotus publishes Deals 1, 2, and 3 in a single `PublishStorageDeals` message.

If `MaxDealsPerPublishMsg` is 2, then in the above example, when deal 2 is ready to be published at 1:30, Lotus would immediately publish Deals 1 & 2 in a single `PublishStorageDeals` message. Deal 3 would be published in a subsequent `PublishStorageDeals` message.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" >}}
If any of the deals in the `PublishStorageDeals` fails validation upon execution, or if the start epoch has passed, all deals will fail to be published.

## Using filters for fine-grained storage and retrieval deal acceptance

Your use case might demand very precise and dynamic control over a combination of deal parameters.

Lotus provides two IPC hooks allowing you to name a command to execute for every deal before the miner accepts it:

- `Filter` for storage deals.
- `RetrievalFilter` for retrieval deals.

The executed command receives a JSON representation of the deal parameters on standard input, and upon completion, its exit code is interpreted as:

- `0`: success, proceed with the deal.
- `non-0`: failure, reject the deal.

The most trivial filter rejecting any retrieval deal would be something like:
`RetrievalFilter = "/bin/false"`. `/bin/false` is binary that immediately exits with a code of `1`.

[This Perl script](https://gist.github.com/ribasushi/53b7383aeb6e6f9b030210f4d64351d5/9bd6e898f94d20b50e7c7586dc8b8f3a45dab07c#file-dealfilter-pl) lets the miner deny specific clients and only accept deals that are set to start relatively soon.

You can also use a third party content policy framework like `bitscreen` by Murmuration Labs:

```shell
# grab filter program
go get -u -v github.com/Murmuration-Labs/bitscreen

# add it to both filters
Filter = "/path/to/go/bin/bitscreen"
RetrievalFilter = "/path/to/go/bin/bitscreen"
```
