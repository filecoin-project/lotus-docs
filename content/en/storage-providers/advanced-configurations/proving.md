While the Lotus-Miner has very reasonable default settings, some storage providers might want to configure some proving parameters according to their setup. Please note that some adanced proving configurations only apply if you are using windowPoSt and/or winningPoSt workers. You can find configurations for these in the [advanced configurations for workers]({{<relref "../..//storage-providers/advanced-configurations/workers/#advanced-post-worker-configurations/" >}})

## Proving section

This section controls some of the behavior around proving in a storage provider setup:

### Pre-check sector timeout

This configuration allows you to set a custom amount of time a proving pre-check for a single sector can take before it will be skipped.

{{< alert icon="warning">}}
Setting this value too low risks sectors being skipped even though they are accessible. Setting this value too high risks missing PoSt deadline in case IO operations related to a single sector are blocked (e.g in case of disconnected mounts)
{{< /alert >}}

```toml
  # type: Duration
  # env var: LOTUS_PROVING_SINGLECHECKTIMEOUT
  #SingleCheckTimeout = "10m0s"
```

### Pre-check partition timeout

This configuration allows you to set a custom amount of time a proving pre-check for a partition can take before it will be skipped.

{{< alert icon="warning">}}
Setting this value too low risks partitions being skipped even though they are accessible. Setting this value too high risks missing PoSt deadline in case IO operations related to this partition are blocked or slow
{{< /alert >}}

```toml
  # type: Duration
  # env var: LOTUS_PROVING_PARTITIONCHECKTIMEOUT
  #PartitionCheckTimeout = "20m0s"
```

### Disable Builtin WindowPoSt

This configuration allows you to disable the windowPoSt comuptation on the lotus-miner process even if no windowPoSt-workers are present.

{{< alert icon="warning">}}
If no windowPoSt workers are connected, window PoSt WILL FAIL resulting in faulty sectors which will need to be recovered. Before enabling this option, make sure your PoSt workers work correctly.
{{< /alert >}}

```toml
# type: bool
# env var: LOTUS_PROVING_DISABLEBUILTINWINNINGPOST
#DisableBuiltinWinningPoSt = false
```

### Disable Builtin WinningPoSt

This configuration allows you to disable the winningPoSt comuptation on the lotus-miner process even if no winningPoSt-workers are present.

{{< alert icon="warning">}}
If no WinningPoSt workers are connected, WinningPoSt will fail resulting in lost block rewards.
{{< /alert >}}

```toml
# type: bool
# env var: LOTUS_PROVING_DISABLEBUILTINWINNINGPOST
#DisableBuiltinWinningPoSt = false
```

### Max partitions per PoSt-message

The maximum number of sectors which can be proven in a single PoSt message is 25000 in network version 16, which means that a single message can prove at most 10 partitions. Note that setting this value lower may result in less efficient gas use - more messages will be sent, to prove each deadline, resulting in more total gas use (but each message will have lower gas limit). Setting this value above the network limit has no effect.

```toml
# type: int
# env var: LOTUS_PROVING_MAXPARTITIONSPERPOSTMESSAGE
#MaxPartitionsPerPoStMessage = 0
```

### Max partitions per recovery message

In some cases when submitting DeclareFaultsRecovered messages, there may be too many recoveries to fit in a BlockGasLimit. In those cases it may be necessary to set this value to something low (eg 1); Note that setting this value lower may result in less efficient gas use - more messages will be sent than needed, resulting in more total gas use (but each message will have lower gas limit).

```toml
# type: int
# env var: LOTUS_PROVING_MAXPARTITIONSPERRECOVERYMESSAGE
#MaxPartitionsPerRecoveryMessage = 0
```

### Single recovery message per partition

In cases when submitting PoSt messages which contain recovering sectors, the default network limit may still be too high to fit in the block gas limit. In those cases, it becomes useful to only house the single partition with recovering sectors in the post message. Note that setting this value lower may result in less efficient gas use - more messages will be sent, to prove each deadline, resulting in more total gas use (but each message will have lower gas limit).

```toml
# type: bool
# env var: LOTUS_PROVING_SINGLERECOVERINGPARTITIONPERPOSTMESSAGE
#SingleRecoveringPartitionPerPostMessage = false
```

### Parallel WindowPoSt batch processing

{{< alert icon="warning" >}}
Experimental feature:
Please be cautious while using this feature as it's still under testing.
{{< /alert >}}

The parallel WindowPoSt batch processing configuration aims to optimize the utilization of WindowPoSt workers by allowing for the parallel processing of multiple WindowPoSts when an SP has multiple partitions within a single deadline.

Setting the value to 0 removes any limit on the number of partitions processed in parallel. However, increasing parallel processing is beneficial only if you have multiple WindowPoSt-workers. If you have just one WindowPoSt-worker, increasing parallelism may actually reduce performance.

```toml
# Maximum number of partition batches to process in parellel. 0 = no limit.
# 
# A partition batch after being processed ends up as a PoSt message, so this limit can also be thought of as "how
# many WindowPoSt messages to create in parallel".
# 
# Note that this is only really useful when multiple PoSt workers are connected and available. If there are no or
# only one PoSt workers the effect will be limited, and performance may even degrade.

# type: int

#MaxBatchParallelism = 1
