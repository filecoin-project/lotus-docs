This feature is supported since lotus v1.15.2.
{{< /alert >}}

While the Lotus Miner runs windowPoSt and winningPoSt by default, you can use specialized `lotus workers` to create a cluster of windowPoSt and winningPoSt workers that can handle multiple Proof-of-Spacetime partitions simultaneously.

A lotus worker instance can only be one of the following:

- WindowPoSt worker
- WinningPoSt worker
- Worker for sealing tasks

## Launching PoSt workers

Before launching your PoSt worker, you need to ensure that your worker meets the minimal requirements for the job it will perform. You should also consider how the PoSt workers can access the sealed sectors and set the correct environment variables before running the workers.

### Minminal requirements

These are the minimal requirements for running each of the PoSt tasks:

| Task | GPU | VRAM | RAM |
| ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
| winningPoSt | Highly recommended |  6 GiB*   |  64 GiB* |
| windowPoSt  | Highly recommended | 8.5 GiB  | 128 GiB  |

*These are conservative numbers. We are currently exploring the lower boundaries for winningPoSt.

Although both tasks can be run with a powerful CPU, using a GPU for these tasks drastically speeds up the process.

### Remote storage access

The windowPoSt process requires reading random leaves of all the sealed sectors in a proving deadline. When setting up windowPoSt workers, one needs to consider how the workers can access those files. The PoSt workers can ask any other worker to read challenges for them, including the `lotus-miner` process, but it will prefer reading it from local paths.

{{< alert icon="warning" >}}
Storage providers should design their worker sectors' access according to their setup size and also redundancy required. If only one worker has read access to the sealed sectors, it can create a single point of failure. If you have multiple partitions in a deadline, having multiple PoSt workers requesting a single worker to read challenges may cause an unwanted I/O load.

### Environment variables

Remember to have the appropriate `nvidia-drivers` and `nvidia-opencl-icd` installed if running OpenCL on your worker. If using CUDA, install the `CUDA-toolkit` and build lotus binaries with `FFI_USE_CUDA=1`

The following environment variables are required to be set before starting the worker:

```shell
export MINER_API_INFO:<TOKEN>:/ip4/<miner_api_address>/tcp/<port>/http
export BELLMAN_CUSTOM_GPU="MODEL-NAME:CORES" # If you´re using a custom GPU
export FIL_PROOFS_PARAMETER_CACHE=/fast/disk/folder # > 100GiB!
```

When the PoSt worker starts, it needs to read and verify the Filecoin proof parameters. We recommend copying them over from your `lotus-miner` machine. Otherwise, they will be downloaded locally on first run.

The PoSt workers will fail to start if the file descriptor limit is not set high enough. You can raise this limit temporarily before starting the worker by running the command `ulimit -n 1048576`. Although, we recommend setting it permanently by following the [Permanently Setting Your ULIMIT System Value]({{< relref "kb#soft-fd-limit" >}}) guide.

### Run the PoSt worker

Use the `run` command to start the worker:

```shell
lotus-worker run <flags>
```

You´ll need to specify which PoSt operation you want the worker to perform with one of the following flags set to true:

```plaintext
--winningpost                 enable winning post (default: false)
--windowpost                  enable window post (default: false)
```

A PoSt worker instance can only be either a winningPoSt worker, or a windowPoSt worker. Enabling a PoSt tasks will automatically disable all other tasks.

When a winningPoSt or windowPoSt worker connects to the `lotus-miner`, it will delegate all winningPoSt or windowPoSt tasks to that worker. If both tasks are delegated to separate PoSt workers, the `lotus-miner` will execute no PoSt tasks locally on the miner instance. If a worker is stopped, the `lotus-miner` instance automatically switches back to local PoSt.

You can verify that PoSt workers are connected to the `lotus-miner` with `lotus-miner proving workers`:

```shell
lotus-miner proving workers
> Worker 0, host windowPoSt
>         CPU:  [                                                                ] 0/48 core(s) in use
>         RAM:  [|                                                               ] 1% 4.005 GiB/119.2 GiB
>         VMEM: [|                                                               ] 1% 4.005 GiB/119.2 GiB
>         GPU:  [                                                                ] 0% 0.00/1 gpu(s) in use
>         GPU: GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, not used
> 
> Worker 1, host winningPoSt
>         CPU:  [                                                                ] 0/16 core(s) in use
>         RAM:  [|                                                               ] 1% 4.005 GiB/119.2 GiB
>         VMEM: [|                                                               ] 1% 4.005 GiB/119.2 GiB
>         GPU:  [                                                                ] 0% 0.00/1 gpu(s) in use
>         GPU: GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, not used
```

You can also verify that PoSt workers are connected in the workers section of `lotus-miner info`.

```shell
lotus-miner info

> Workers:
> 
>     Seal: 15
>     WdPoSt: 4
>     WinPoSt: 3
```

## Multiple partitions

If you have multiple partitions in a single proving deadline and multiple windowPoSt workers, each partition will run on separate workers in parallel, up to the number of partitions.

Consider this proving deadline with four full partitions:

```plaintext
lotus-miner proving deadlines
Miner: f011235
deadline  partitions  sectors (faults)  proven partitions
0         4           9396 (0)          0
```

If the storage provider has four windowPoSt workers connected, the `lotus-miner` will compute each of the partitions on each of the workers in parallel. If one windowPoSt worker gets disconnected, leaving you with only three windowPoSt workers, the first three partitions will be computed in parallel. The first windowPoSt worker will pick up the last partition to finish its computation.

Depending on the scale of your operation it may be necessary to fine-tune the proving processes of your storage provider. This is particularly true in the case of `DeclareFaultsRecovered` messages across multiple partitions. This is done in the `Proving` section of the Lotus Miner's `config.toml`:

```toml
[Proving]
  # Maximum number of sector checks to run in parallel. (0 = unlimited)
  #
  # type: int
  # env var: LOTUS_PROVING_PARALLELCHECKLIMIT
  #ParallelCheckLimit = 128

  # Setting this value above the network limit has no effect
  #
  # type: int
  # env var: LOTUS_PROVING_MAXPARTITIONSPERPOSTMESSAGE
  #MaxPartitionsPerPoStMessage = 0

  # In some cases when submitting DeclareFaultsRecovered messages,
  # there may be too many recoveries to fit in a BlockGasLimit.
  # In those cases it may be necessary to set this value to something low (eg 1);
  # Note that setting this value lower may result in less efficient gas use - more messages will be sent than needed,
  # resulting in more total gas use (but each message will have lower gas limit)
  #
  # type: int
  # env var: LOTUS_PROVING_MAXPARTITIONSPERRECOVERYMESSAGE
  #MaxPartitionsPerRecoveryMessage = 0
```

### Testing the setup

When making changes to your PoSt setup it is useful to verify that the changes works as intended without testing it on a real proving period and risk failing windowPoSt.

After you have set up your windowPoSt workers you can manually trigger a windowPoSt with `lotus-miner proving compute window-post [deadline index]`. It will not send any messages to the chain.

{{< alert icon="tip" >}}
This should be scheduled outside of any proving deadlines. Check `lotus-miner proving info` to see when your next proving period starts.
