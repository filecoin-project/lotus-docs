## Create a multsig wallet

Use `lotus msig create` to a multisig wallet:

```shell with-output
lotus msig create signerAddress1 signerAddress2 signerAddress3...
```
```
Created new multisig:  f01002 f24mscgjtgymb3dqtm4ycwydh4nhygktgxm3nbgva
```

In the above example, `f01002` is the id address and `f24mscgjtgymb3dqtm4ycwydh4nhygktgxm3nbgva` is the actor address. Both addresses represent the newly created multisig wallet.

By default, signatures from all signers are required for approving a transaction. However, you can change the number of required approvals by using the `--required` option:

```shell
lotus msig create --required=2 signerAddress1 signerAddress2 signerAddress3
```

The above example creates a multisig wallet with three signers but only requires two approvals for a transaction to be executed.

## Propose and approve a transaction

Any signer of a multisig wallet can _propose_ a transaction. The _proposer_ automatically approves a transaction upon the proposal. A transaction will only be executed when the number of approvals received equals the number of required approvals. A [multisig wallet can be inspected](#inspect-a-multisig-wallet) to get the number of required approvals. If a multisig wallet only requires one signer, then a transaction will be executed immediately upon its proposal.

Use `lotus msig propose` to propose a transaction:

````shell with-output
lotus msig propose --from=proposerAddress walletAddress destinationAddress value
````
````
send proposal in message:  bafy2bzaceajm2mghc5rludlbcr3bnpqgcz5m6gmldq6ycrc4trkejz36tnrqe
Transaction ID: 0
````

In the above example `bafy2bzaceajm2mghc5rludlbcr3bnpqgcz5m6gmldq6ycrc4trkejz36tnrqe` is the `messageID`, and `0` is the `transactionID`.

Other signers can use `lotus msig approve` to approve the messages:

```shell
lotus msig approve walletAddress transactionID proposerAddress destinationAddress value
```

The value of `transactionID`, `proposerAddress`, `destinationAddress` and `value` must match the values used in the proposal.

## Inspect a multisig wallet

Use `lotus msig inspect` to get information about the multisig wallet:

```shell with-output
lotus msig inspect walletaddress
```
```
