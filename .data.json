There is no guarantee this testing configuration will be suitable for Filecoin storage mining at MainNet launch. If you need to buy new hardware to join the Filecoin Testnet, we recommend to buy no more hardware than you require for testing. To learn more please read this [Protocol Labs Standard Testing Configuration post](https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-testnet-mining/).\n\n**Sector sizes** and **minimum pledged storage** required to mine blocks are two very important Filecoin Testnet parameters that impact hardware decisions. We will continue to refine all parameters during Testnet.\n\nBECAUSE OF THIS, OUR STANDARD TESTING CONFIGURATION FOR FILECOIN MAINNET CAN AND WILL CHANGE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n\n## Example configuration\n\nThe setup below is a minimal example for sealing 32 GiB sectors on Lotus:\n\n- 2 TB of hard drive space.\n- 8 core CPU\n- 128 GiB of RAM\n\nNote that 1GB sectors don't require as high of specs, but are likely to be removed as we improve the performance of 32GB sector sealing.\n\nFor the first part of the sealing process, AMD CPU's are __highly recommended__, because of the `Intel SHA Extensions` instruction set that is available there ever since the `Zen` microarchitecture. Hence, AMD CPU's seem to perform much better on the testnet than other CPU's. Contrary to what the name implies, this extended instruction set is not available on recent Intel desktop/server chips. \n\n## Testnet discoveries\n\n- If you only have 128GiB of ram, enabling 256GB of **NVMe** swap on an SSD will help you avoid out-of-memory issues while mining.\n\n## Benchmarked GPUs\n\nGPUs are a must for getting **block rewards**. Here are a few that have been confirmed to generate **SNARKs** quickly enough to successfully mine blocks on the Lotus Testnet.\n\n- GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n- GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\n- GeForce RTX 2080\n- GeForce GTX 1080 Ti\n- GeForce GTX 1080\n- GeForce GTX 1060\n\n## Testing other GPUs\n\nIf you want to test a GPU that is not explicitly supported, use the following global **environment variable**:\n\n```sh\nBELLMAN_CUSTOM_GPU=\"<NAME>:<NUMBER_OF_CORES>\"\n```\n\nHere is an example of trying a GeForce GTX 1660 Ti with 1536 cores.\n\n```sh\nBELLMAN_CUSTOM_GPU=\"GeForce GTX 1660 Ti:1536\"\n```\n\nTo get the number of cores for your GPU, you will need to check your card’s specifications.\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nHere is a [benchmarking tool](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/tree/master/cmd/lotus-bench) and a [GitHub issue thread](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/694) for those who wish to experiment with and contribute hardware setups for the **Filecoin Testnet**.\n"}]},{"title":"Setup","slug":"en+getting-started","github":"en/getting-started.md","value":"# Lotus\n\nLotus is an implementation of the **Filecoin Distributed Storage Network**.

To improve your connectivity, be sure to: \n\n- [Set the multiaddresses for you miner to listen on](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/connectivity/#setting-multiaddresses)\n- [Maintain a healthy peer count](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/connectivity/#checking-peer-count)\n- [Enable port forwarding](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/connectivity/#port-forwarding)\n- [Configure your public IP address and port](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/connectivity/#setting-a-public-ip-address)\n\n## Monitor the dashboard\n\nTo see the latest network activity, including **chain block height**, **block height**, **blocktime**, **total network power**, largest **block producer miner**, check out the [monitoring dashboard](https://stats.testnet.filecoin.io).\n"},{"title":"Use Lotus with systemd","slug":"en+install-systemd-services","github":"en/install-systemd-services.md","value":"# Use Lotus with systemd\n\nLotus is capable of running as a systemd service daemon. You can find installable service files for systemd in the [lotus repo scripts directory](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/tree/master/scripts) as files with `.service` extension. In order to install these service files, you can copy these `.service` files to the default systemd unit load path.\n\nThe services expect their binaries to be present in `/usr/local/bin/`. You can use `make` to install them by running:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo make install\n```\n\nfor `lotus` and `lotus-storage-miner` and \n\n```sh\n$ sudo make install-chainwatch\n```\n\nfor the `chainwatch` tool.\n\n## Installing services via `make`\n\nIf your host uses the default systemd unit load path, the `lotus-daemon` and `lotus-miner` services can be installed by running:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo make install-services\n```\n\nTo install the the `lotus-chainwatch` service run:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo make install-chainwatch-service\n```\n\nYou can install all services together by running:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo make install-all-services\n```\n\nThe `lotus-daemon` and the `lotus-miner` services can be installed individually too by running:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo make install-daemon-service\n```\n\nand \n\n```sh\n$ sudo make install-miner-service\n```\n\n### Notes\n\nWhen installing the `lotus-miner` and/or `lotus-chainwatch` service the `lotus-daemon` service gets automatically installed since the other two services depend on it being installed to run.\n\nAll `install-*-service*` commands will install the latest binaries in the lotus build folders to `/usr/local/bin/`. If you do not want to use the latest build binaries please copy the `*.service` files by hand.\n\n## Removing via `make`\n\nAll services can beremoved via `make`. To remove all services together run:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo make clean-all-services\n```\n\nIndividual services can be removed by running:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo make clean-chainwatch-services\n$ sudo make clean-miner-services\n$ sudo make clean-daemon-services\n```\n\n### Notes\n\nThe services will be stoppend and disabled when removed.\n\nRemoving the `lotus-daemon` service will automatically remove the depending services `lotus-miner` and `lotus-chainwatch`.\n\n\n## Controlling services\n\nAll service can be controlled with the `systemctl`. A few basic control commands are listed below. To get detailed infos about the capabilities of the `systemctl` command please consult your distributions man pages by running: \n\n```sh\n$ man systemctl\n```\n\n### Start/Stop services\n\nYou can start the services by running:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo systemctl start lotus-daemon\n$ sudo systemctl start lotus-miner\n$ sudo systemctl start lotus-chainwatch\n```\n\nand can be stopped by running:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo systemctl stop lotus-daemon\n$ sudo systemctl stop lotus-miner\n$ sudo systemctl stop lotus-chainwatch\n```\n\n### Enabling services on startup\n\nTo enable the services to run automatically on startup execute:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo systemctl enable lotus-daemon\n$ sudo systemctl enable lotus-miner\n$ sudo systemctl enable lotus-chainwatch\n```\n\nTo disable the services on startup run:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo systemctl disable lotus-daemon\n$ sudo systemctl disable lotus-miner\n$ sudo systemctl disable lotus-chainwatch\n```\n### Notes\n\nSystemd will not let services be enabled or started without their requirements. Starting the `lotus-chainwatch` and/or `lotus-miner` service with automatically start the `lotus-daemon` service (if installed!). Stopping the `lotus-daemon` service will stop the other two services. The same pattern is executed for enabling and disabling the services. \n\n## Interacting with service logs\n\nLogs from the services can be reviewed using `journalctl`.\n\n### Follow logs from a specific service unit\n\n```sh\n$ sudo journalctl -u lotus-daemon -f\n```\n\n### View logs in reverse order\n\n```sh\n$ sudo journalctl -u lotus-miner -r\n```\n\n### Log files\n\nBesides the systemd service logs all services save their own log files in `/var/log/lotus/`.\n"},{"title":"Setup Troubleshooting","slug":"en+setup-troubleshooting","github":"en/setup-troubleshooting.md","value":"# Setup Troubleshooting\n\n## Config: Clearing data\n\nHere is a command that will delete your chain data, stored wallets, stored data and any miners you have set up:\n\n```sh\nrm -rf ~/.lotus ~/.lotusminer\n```\n\nThis command usually resolves any issues with running `lotus` but it is not always required for updates.

FIXME, missing)\n- External libraries used by Lotus and other deps (FIXME, missing)\n\n# Preliminaries\n\nWe discuss some key Filecoin concepts here, aiming to explain them by contrasting them with analogous concepts\nin other well-known blockchains like Ethereum. We only provide brief descriptions here; elaboration\ncan be found in the [spec](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs/).\n\n### Tipsets\n\nUnlike in Ethereum, a block can have multiple parents in Filecoin. We thus refer to the parent set of a block,\ninstead of a single parent.\nA [tipset](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs/#systems__filecoin_blockchain__struct__tipset)\nis any set of blocks that share the same parent set.\n\nThere is no concept of \"block difficulty\" in Filecoin. Instead,\nthe weight of a tipset is simply the number of blocks in the chain that ends in that tipset. Note that a longer chain\ncan have less weight than a shorter chain with more blocks per tipset.\n\nWe also allow for \"null\" tipsets, which include zero blocks. This allows miners to \"skip\" a round, and build on top\nof an imaginary empty tipset if they want to.\n\nWe call the heaviest tipset in a chain the \"head\" of the chain.\n\n### Actors and Messages\n\nAn [Actor](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs/#systems__filecoin_vm__actor)\n is analogous to a smart contract in Ethereum. Filecoin does not allow users to define their own\nactors, but comes with several [builtin actors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors),\nwhich can be thought of as pre-compiled contracts.\n\nA [Message](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs/#systems__filecoin_vm__message)\nis analogous to transactions in Ethereum.\n\n# Sync\n\nSync refers to the process by which a Lotus node synchronizes to the heaviest chain being advertised by its peers.\nAt a high-level, Lotus syncs in a manner similar to most other blockchains; a Lotus node listens to the various\nchains its peers claim to be at, picks the heaviest one, requests the blocks in the chosen chain,\nand validates each block in that chain, running all state transitions along the way.\n\nThe majority of the sync functionality happens in the [`Syncer`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/sync.go),\ninternally managed by a [`SyncManager`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/sync_manager.go).\n\nWe now discuss the various stages of the sync process.\n\n## Sync setup\n\nWhen a Lotus node connects to a new peer, we exchange the head of our chain\nwith the new peer through [the `hello` protocol](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/node/hello/hello.go).\nIf the peer's head is heavier than ours, we try to sync to it. Note\nthat we do NOT update our chain head at this stage.\n\n## Fetching and Persisting Block Headers\n\nNote: The API refers to these stages as `StageHeaders` and `StagePersistHeaders`.\n\nWe proceed in the sync process by requesting block headers from the peer,\nmoving back from their head, until we reach a tipset that we have in common\n(such a common tipset must exist, thought it may simply be the genesis block).\nThe functionality can be found in `Syncer::collectHeaders()`.\n\nIf the common tipset is our head, we treat the sync as a \"fast-forward\", else we must\ndrop part of our chain to connect to the peer's head (referred to as \"forking\").\n\nFIXME: This next para might be best replaced with a link to the validation doc\nSome of the possible causes of failure in this stage include:\n\n- The chain is linked to a block that we have previously marked as bad,\nand stored in a [`BadBlockCache`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/badtscache.go).\n- The beacon entries in a block are inconsistent (FIXME: more details about what is validated here wouldn't be bad).\n- Switching to this new chain would involve a chain reorganization beyond the allowed threshold (SPECK-CHECK).\n\n## Fetching and Validating Blocks\n\nNote: The API refers to this stage as `StageMessages`.\n\nHaving acquired the headers and found a common tipset, we then move forward, requesting the full blocks, including the messages.\n\nFor each block, we  first confirm the syntactic validity of the block (SPECK-CHECK),\nwhich includes the syntactic validity of messages included\nin the block.\nWe then apply the messages, running all the state transitions, and compare the state root we calculate with the provided state root.\n\n\nFIXME: This next para might be best replaced with a link to the validation doc\nSome of the possible causes of failure in this stage include:\n\n- a block is syntactically invalid (including potentially containing syntactically invalid messages)\n- the computed state root after applying the block doesn't match the block's state root\n- FIXME: Check what's covered by syntactic validity, and add anything important that isn't (like proof validity, future checks, etc.)\n\nThe core functionality can be found in `Syncer::ValidateTipset()`, with `Syncer::checkBlockMessages()` performing\nsyntactic validation of messages.\n\n## Setting the head\n\nNote: The API refers to this stage as `StageSyncComplete`.\n\nIf all validations pass we will now set that head as our heaviest tipset in\n[`ChainStore`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/store/store.go).\nWe already have the full state, since we calculated\nit during the sync process.\n\nFIXME (aayush) I don't fuilly understand the next 2 paragraphs, but it seems important. Confirm and polish.\nRelevant issue in IPFS: https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/issues/264\n\nIt is important to note at this point that similar to the IPFS architecture of addressing by content and not by location/address (FIXME: check and link to IPFS docs) the \"actual\" chain stored in the node repo is *relative* to which CID we look for. We always have stored a series of Filecoin blocks pointing to other blocks, each a potential chain in itself by following its parent's reference, and its parent's parent, and so on up to the genesis block. (FIXME: We need a diagram here, one of the Filecoin blog entries might have something similar to what we are describing here.) It only depends on *where* (location) do we start to look for. The *only* address/location reference we hold of the chain, a relative reference, is the `heaviest` pointer. This is reflected by the fact that we don't store it in the `Blockstore` by a fixed, *absolute*, CID that reflects its contents, as this will change each time we sync to a new head (FIXME: link to the immutability IPFS doc that I need to write).\n\nFIXME: Create a further reading appendix, move this next para to it, along with other\nextraneous content\nThis is one of the few items we store in `Datastore` by key, location, allowing its contents to change on every sync. This is reflected in the `(*ChainStore) writeHead()` function (called by `takeHeaviestTipSet()` above) where we reference the pointer by the explicit `chainHeadKey` address (the string `\"head\"`, not a hash embedded in a CID), and similarly in `(*ChainStore).Load()` when we start the node and create the `ChainStore`. Compare this to a Filecoin block or message which are immutable, stored in the `Blockstore` by CID, once created they never change.\n\n## Keeping up with the chain\n\nA Lotus node also listens for new blocks broadcast by its peers over the `gossipsub` channel (see FIXME for more).\nIf we have validated such a block's parent tipset, and adding it to our tipset at its height would lead to a heavier\nhead, then we validate and add this block. The validation described is identical to that invoked during the sync\nprocess (indeed, it's the same codepath).\n\n# State\n\nIn Filecoin, the chain state at any given point is  a collection of data stored under a root CID\nencapsulated in the [`StateTree`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/state/statetree.go),\nand accessed through the\n[`StateManager`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/stmgr/stmgr.go).\nThe state at the chain's head is thus easily tracked and updated in a state root CID.\n(FIXME: Talk about CIDs somewhere,  we might want to explain some of the modify/flush/update-root mechanism here.))\n\n## Calculating a Tipset State\n\nRecall that a tipset is a set of blocks that have identical parents (that is, that are built on top of the same tipset).\nThe genesis tipset comprises the genesis block(s), and has some state corresponding to it.\n\nThe methods `TipSetState()` and `computeTipSetState()` in\n[`StateManager`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/stmgr/stmgr.go)\n are responsible for computing\nthe state that results from applying a tipset. This involves applying all the messages included\nin the tipset, and performing implicit operations like awarding block rewards.\n\nAny valid block built on top of a tipset `ts` should have its Parent State Root equal to the result of\ncalculating the tipset state of `ts`. Note that this means that all blocks in a tipset must have the same Parent\nState Root (which is to be expected, since they have the same parent tipset)\n\n### Preparing to apply a tipset\n\nWhen `StateManager::computeTipsetState()` is called with a tipset, `ts`,\nit retrieves the parent state root of the blocks in `ts`. It also creates a list of `BlockMessages`, which wraps the BLS\nand SecP messages in a block along with the miner that produced the block.\n\nControl then flows to `StateManager::ApplyBlocks()`, which builds a VM to apply the messages given to it. The VM\nis initialized with the parent state root of the blocks in `ts`. We apply the blocks in `ts` in order (see FIXME for\nordering of blocks in a tipset).\n\n### Applying a block\n\nFor each block, we prepare to apply the ordered messages (first BLS, then SecP). Before applying a message, we check if\nwe have already applied a message with that CID within the scope of this method. If so, we simply skip that message;\nthis is how duplicate messages included in the same tipset are skipped (with only the miner of the \"first\" block to\ninclude the message getting the reward). For the actual process of message application, see FIXME (need an\ninternal link here), for now we\nsimply assume that the outcome of the VM applying a message is either an error, or a\n[`MessageReceipt`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/types/message_receipt.go)\n and some\nother information.\n\nWe treat an error from the VM as a showstopper; there is no recovery, and no meaningful state can be computed for `ts`.\nGiven a successful receipt, we add the rewards and penalties to what the miner has earned so far. Once all the messages\nincluded in a block have been applied (or skipped if they're a duplicate), we use an implicit message to call\nthe Reward Actor. This awards the miner their reward for having won a block, and also awards / penalizes them based\non the message rewards and penalties we tracked.\n\nWe then proceed to apply the next block in `ts`, using the same VM. This means that the state changes that result\nfrom applying a message are visible when applying all subsequent messages, even if they are included in a different block.\n\n### Finishing up\n\nHaving applied all the blocks, we send one more implicit message, to the Cron Actor, which handles operations that\nmust be performed at the end of every epoch (see FIXME for more). The resulting state after calling the Cron Actor\nis the computed state of the tipset.\n\n# Virtual Machine\n\nThe Virtual Machine (VM) is responsible for executing messages.\nThe [Lotus Virtual Machine](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/vm/vm.go)\ninvokes the appropriate methods in the builtin actors, and provides\na [`Runtime`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/blob/master/actors/runtime/runtime.go)\ninterface to the [builtin actors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors)\nthat exposes their state, allows them to take certain actions, and meters\ntheir gas usage. The VM also performs balance transfers, creates new account actors as needed, and tracks the gas reward,\npenalty, return value, and exit code.\n\n## Applying a Message\n\nThe primary entrypoint of the VM is the `ApplyMessage()` method. This method should not return an error\nunless something goes unrecoverably wrong.\n\nThe first thing this method does is assess if the message provided meets any of the penalty criteria.\nIf so, a penalty is issued, and the method returns. Next, the entire gas cost of the message is transferred to\na temporary gas holder account. It is from this gas holder that gas will be deducted; if it runs out of gas, the message\nfails. Any unused gas in this holder will be refunded to the message's sender at the end of message execution.\n\nThe VM then increments the sender's nonce, takes a snapshot of the state, and invokes `VM::send()`.\n\nThe `send()` method creates a [`Runtime`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/vm/runtime.go)\n for the subsequent message execution.\nIt then transfers the message's value to the recipient, creating a new account actor if needed.\n\n### Method Invocation\n\nWe use reflection to translate a Filecoin message for the VM to an actual Go function, relying on the VM's\n[`invoker`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/vm/invoker.go) structure.\nEach actor has its own set of codes defined in `specs-actors/actors/builtin/methods.go`.\nThe `invoker` structure maps the builtin actors' CIDs\n to a list of `invokeFunc` (one per exported method), which each take the `Runtime` (for state manipulation)\n and the serialized input parameters.\n\nFIXME (aayush) Polish this next para.\n\nThe basic layout (without reflection details) of `(*invoker).transform()` is as follows. From each actor registered in `NewInvoker()` we take its `Exports()` methods converting them to `invokeFunc`s. The actual method is wrapped in another function that takes care of decoding the serialized parameters and the runtime, this function is passed to `shimCall()` that will encapsulate the actors code being run inside a `defer` function to `recover()` from panics (we fail in the actors code with panics to unwrap the stack). The return values will then be (CBOR) marshaled and returned to the VM.\n\n### Returning from the VM\n\nOnce method invocation is complete (including any subcalls), we return to `ApplyMessage()`, which receives\nthe serialized response and the [`ActorError`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/actors/aerrors/error.go).\nThe sender will be charged the appropriate amount of gas for the returned response, which gets put into the\n[`MessageReceipt`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/types/message_receipt.go).\n\nThe method then refunds any unused gas to the sender, sets up the gas reward for the miner, and\nwraps all of this into an `ApplyRet`, which is returned.\n\n# Building a Lotus node\n\nWhen we launch a Lotus node with the command `./lotus daemon`\n(see [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/cmd/lotus/daemon.go) for more),\nthe node is created through [dependency injection](https://godoc.org/go.uber.org/fx).\nThis relies on reflection, which makes some of the references hard to follow.\nThe node sets up all of the subsystems it needs to run, such as the repository, the network connections, thechain sync\nservice, etc.\nThis setup is orchestrated through calls to the `node.Override` function.\nThe structure of each call indicates the type of component it will set up\n(many defined in [`node/modules/dtypes/`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/tree/master/node/modules/dtypes)),\nand the function that will provide it.\nThe dependency is implicit in the argument of the provider function.\n\nAs an example, consider the `modules.ChainStore()` function that provides the\n[`ChainStore`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/store/store.go) structure.\nIt takes as one of its parameters the [`ChainBlockstore`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/node/modules/dtypes/storage.go)\ntype, which becomes one of its dependencies.\nFor the node to be built successfully the `ChainBlockstore` will need to be provided before `ChainStore`, a requirement\nthat is made explicit in another `Override()` call that sets the provider of that type as the `ChainBlockstore()` function.\n\n## The Repository\n\nThe repo is the directory where all of a node's information is stored. The node is entirely defined by its repo, which\nmakes it easy to port to another location. This one-to-one relationship means we can speak\nof the node as the repo it is associated with, instead of the daemon process that runs from that repo.\n\nOnly one daemon can run be running with an associated repo at a time.\nA process signals that it is running a node associated with a particular repo, by creating and acquiring\na `repo.lock`.\n\n```sh\nlsof ~/.lotus/repo.lock\n# COMMAND   PID\n# lotus   52356\n```\nTrying to launch a second daemon hooked to the same repo leads to a `repo is already locked (lotus daemon already running)`\nerror.\n\nThe `node.Repo()` function (`node/builder.go`) contains most of the dependencies (specified as `Override()` calls)\nneeded to properly set up the node's repo. We list the most salient ones here.\n\n### Datastore\n\n`Datastore` and `ChainBlockstore`: Data related to the node state is saved in the repo's `Datastore`,\nan IPFS interface defined [here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-datastore/blob/master/datastore.go).\nLotus creates this interface from a [Badger DB](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) in\n [`FsRepo`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/node/repo/fsrepo.go).\nEvery piece of data is fundamentally a key-value pair in the `datastore` directory of the repo.\nThere are several abstractions laid on top of it that appear through the code depending on *how* we access it,\nbut it is important to remember that we're always accessing it from the same place.\n\nFIXME: Maybe mention the `Batching` interface as the developer will stumble upon it before reaching the `Datastore` one.\n\n#### Blocks\n\nFIXME: IPFS blocks vs Filecoin blocks ideally happens before this / here\n\nThe [`Blockstore` interface](`github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-blockstore/blockstore.go`) structures the key-value pair\ninto the CID format for the key and the [`Block` interface](`github.com/ipfs/go-block-format/blocks.go`) for the value.\nThe `Block` value is just a raw string of bytes addressed by its hash, which is included in the CID key.\n\n`ChainBlockstore` creates a `Blockstore` in the repo under the `/blocks` namespace.\nEvery key stored there will have the `blocks` prefix so that it does not collide with other stores that use the same repo.\n\nFIXME: Link to IPFS documentation about DAG, CID, and related, especially we need a diagram that shows how do we wrap each datastore inside the next layer (datastore, batching, block store, gc, etc).\n\n#### Metadata\n\n`modules.Datastore()` creates a `dtypes.MetadataDS`, which is an alias for the basic `Datastore` interface.\nMetadata is stored here under the `/metadata` prefix.\n(FIXME: Explain *what* is metadata in contrast with the block store, namely we store the pointer to the heaviest chain, we might just link to that unwritten section here later.)\n\nFIXME: Explain the key store related calls (maybe remove, per Schomatis)\n\n### LockedRepo\n\n`LockedRepo()`: This method doesn't create or initialize any new structures, but rather registers an\n `OnStop` [hook](https://godoc.org/go.uber.org/fx/internal/lifecycle#Hook)\n that will close the locked repository associated with it on shutdown.\n\n\n### Repo types / Node types\n\nFIXME: This section needs to be clarified / corrected...I don't fully understand the config differences (what do they have in common, if anything?)\n\nAt the end of the `Repo()` function we see two mutually exclusive configuration calls based on the `RepoType` (`node/repo/fsrepo.go`).\n```Go\n\t\t\tApplyIf(isType(repo.FullNode), ConfigFullNode(c)),\n\t\t\tApplyIf(isType(repo.StorageMiner), ConfigStorageMiner(c)),\n```\nAs we said, the repo fully identifies the node so a repo type is also a *node* type, in this case a full node or a miner. (FIXME: What is the difference between the two, does *full* imply miner?) In this case the `daemon` command will create a `FullNode`, this is specified in the command logic itself in `main.DaemonCmd()`, the `FsRepo` created (and passed to `node.Repo()`) will be initiated with that type (see `(*FsRepo).Init(t RepoType)`).\n\n## Online\n\nFIXME: Much of this might need to be subsumed into the p2p section\n\nThe `node.Online()` configuration function (`node/builder.go`) initializes components that involve connecting to,\nor interacting with, the Filecoin network. These connections are managed through the libp2p stack (FIXME link to this section when it exists).\nWe discuss some of the components found in the full node type (that is, included in the `ApplyIf(isType(repo.FullNode),` call).\n\n#### Chainstore\n\n`modules.ChainStore()` creates the [`store.ChainStore`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/chain/store/store.go))\nthat wraps the stores\n previously instantiated in `Repo()`. It is the main point of entry for the node to all chain-related data\n (FIXME: this is incorrect, we sometimes access its underlying block store directly, and probably shouldn't).\n It also holds the crucial `heaviest` pointer, which indicates the current head of the chain.\n\n #### ChainExchange and ChainBlockservice\n`ChainExchange()` and `ChainBlockservice()` establish a BitSwap connection (FIXME libp2p link)\nto exchange chain information in the form of `blocks.Block`s stored in the repo. (See sync section for more details, the Filecoin blocks and messages are backed by these raw IPFS blocks that together form the different structures that define the state of the current/heaviest chain.)\n\n#### Incoming handlers\n`HandleIncomingBlocks()` and `HandleIncomingMessages()` start the services in charge of processing new Filecoin blocks\nand messages from the network (see `<undefined>` for more information about the topics the node is subscribed to, FIXME: should that be part of the libp2p section or should we expand on gossipsub separately?).\n\n#### Hello\n`RunHello()`: starts the services to both send (`(*Service).SayHello()`) and receive (`(*Service).HandleStream()`, `node/hello/hello.go`)\n`hello` messages. When nodes establish a new connection with each other, they exchange these messages\nto share chain-related information (namely their genesis block and their heaviest tipset).\n\n#### Syncer\n`NewSyncer()` creates the `Syncer` structure and starts the services related to the chain sync process (FIXME link).\n\n### Ordering the dependencies\n\nWe can establish the dependency relations by looking at the parameters that each function needs and by understanding\nthe architecture of the node and how the different components relate to each other (the chief purpose of this document).\n\nAs an example, the sync mechanism depends on the node being able to exchange different IPFS blocks with the network,\nso as to be able to request the \"missing pieces\" needed to construct the chain. This dependency is reflected by `NewSyncer()`\nhaving a `blocksync.BlockSync` parameter, which in turn depends on `ChainBlockservice()` and `ChainExchange()`.\nThe chain exchange service further depends on the chain store to save and retrieve chain data, which is reflected\nin `ChainExchange()` having `ChainGCBlockstore` as a parameter (which is just a wrapper around `ChainBlockstore` capable\n of garbage collection).\n\nThis block store is the same store underlying the chain store, which is an indirect dependency of `NewSyncer()` (through the `StateManager`).\n(FIXME: This last line is flaky, we need to resolve the hierarchy better, we sometimes refer to the chain store and sometimes to its underlying block store. We need a diagram to visualize all the different components just mentioned otherwise it is too hard to follow. We probably even need to skip some of the connections mentioned.)\n","posts":[{"title":"The Message Pool","slug":"en+mpool","github":"en/mpool.md","value":"# The Message Pool\n\nThe Message Pool (mpool) is the component of lotus that handles\npending messages for inclusion in the chain. Messages are added to the\nmpool either directly for locally published messages or through pubsub\npropagation.  Whenever a miner is ready to create a block for a\ntipset, it invokes the mpool selection algorithm which selects an\nappropriate set of messages such that it optimizes miner reward and\nchain capacity.\n\n## API\n\nThe full node API defines the following methods for interacting with the mpool:\n```\n    MpoolPending(context.Context, types.TipSetKey) ([]*types.SignedMessage, error)\n    MpoolSelect(context.Context, types.TipSetKey, float64) ([]*types.SignedMessage, error)\n    MpoolPush(context.Context, *types.SignedMessage) (cid.Cid, error)\n    MpoolPushMessage(ctx context.Context, msg *types.Message, spec *MessageSendSpec) (*types.SignedMessage, error)\n    MpoolGetNonce(context.Context, address.Address) (uint64, error)\n    MpoolSub(context.Context) (<-chan MpoolUpdate, error)\n    MpoolGetConfig(context.Context) (*types.MpoolConfig, error)\n    MpoolSetConfig(context.Context, *types.MpoolConfig) error\n    MpoolClear(context.Context, local bool) error\n```\n\n### MpoolPending\n\nReturns the list of messages that are pending for a tipset.\n\n### MpoolSelect\n\nSelects and returns a list of pending messages for inclusion in the next block.\n\n### MpoolPush\n\nPushes a signed message to the mpool; returns the CID of the message.\n\n### MpoolPushMessage\n\nAtomically assigns a nonce, signs, and pushes a message to the mpool.\n\nThe MaxFee field of the spec argument is only used when\nGasFeeCap/GasPremium fields aren't specified in the message.

Note that messages from priority addresses are never pruned.\n  Defafult is 30000.\n- `SizeLimitLow` -- this is the number of pending messages that should be kept after a prune.\n  Default is 20000.\n- `ReplaceByFeeRatio` -- this is the gas fee ratio for replacing messages in the mpool.\n  Whenever a message is replaced, the `GasPremium` must be increased by this ratio.\n  Default is 1.25.\n- `PruneCooldown` -- this is the period of time to wait before triggering a new prune.\n  Default is 1min.\n- `GasLimitOverestimation` -- this is a parameter that controls the gas limit overestimation for new messages.\n  Default is 1.25.\n\n\n## Message Selection\n\nA few words regarding message selection are pertinent. In message\nselection, a miner selects a set of messages from the pending messages\nfor inclusion to the next block in order to maximize its reward. The\nproblem however is NP-hard (it's an instance of knapsack packing),\nfurther confounded by the fact that miners don't communicate their\ntickets to each other. So at best we can approximate the optimal\nselection in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe mpool employs a sophisticated algorithm for selecting messages for\ninclusion, given the ticket quality of a miner. The ticket quality\nreflects the probability of execution order for a block in the\ntipset. Given the ticket quality the algorithm computes the\nprobability of each block, and picks dependent chains of messages such\nthat the reward is maximized, while also optimizing the capacity of\nthe chain.  If the ticket quality is sufficiently high, then a greedy\nselection algorithm is used instead that simply picks dependent chains of\nmaximum reward.

The `ListenAddresses` in this file should be interface listen addresses (usually `/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/PORT`), and the `AnnounceAddresses` should match the addresses being passed to `set-addrs`.\n\nThe addresses passed to `set-addrs` parameter in the commands below should be currently active and dialable; confirm they are before entering them.\n\nOnce the config file has been updated, set the on-chain record of the miner's listen addresses:\n\n```\nlotus-miner actor set-addrs <multiaddr_1> <multiaddr_2> ... <multiaddr_n>\n```\n\nThis updates the `MinerInfo` object in the miner's actor, which will be looked up\nwhen a client attempts to make a deal. Any number of addresses can be provided.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nlotus-miner actor set-addrs /ip4/123.123.73.123/tcp/12345 /ip4/223.223.83.223/tcp/23456\n```\n\n# Separate address for windowPoSt messages\n\nWindowPoSt is the mechanism through which storage is verified in Filecoin. It requires miners to submit proofs for all sectors every 24h, which require sending messages to the chain.\n\nBecause many other mining related actions require sending messages to the chain, and not all of those are \"high value\", it may be desirable to use a separate account to send PoSt messages from. This allows for setting lower GasFeeCaps on the lower value messages without creating head-of-line blocking problems for the PoSt messages in congested chain conditions\n\nTo set this up, first create a new account, and send it some funds for gas fees:\n```sh\nlotus wallet new bls\nt3defg...\n\nlotus send t3defg... 100\n```\n\nNext add the control address\n```sh\nlotus-miner actor control set t3defg...\nAdd t3defg...\nPass --really-do-it to actually execute this action\n```\n\nNow actually set the addresses\n```sh\nlotus-miner actor control set --really-do-it t3defg...\nAdd t3defg...\nMessage CID: bafy2..\n```\n\nWait for the message to land on chain\n```sh\nlotus state wait-msg bafy2..\n...\nExit Code: 0\n...\n```\n\nCheck miner control address list to make sure the address was correctly setup\n```sh\nlotus-miner actor control list\nname       ID      key           use    balance\nowner      t01111  t3abcd...  other  300 FIL\nworker     t01111  t3abcd...  other  300 FIL\ncontrol-0  t02222  t3defg...  post   100 FIL\n```\n","posts":[{"title":"Lotus Worker","slug":"en+lotus-worker","github":"en/mining-lotus-worker.md","value":"# Lotus Worker\n\nThe **Lotus Worker** is an extra process that can offload heavy processing tasks from your **Lotus Miner**. The sealing process automatically runs in the **Lotus Miner** process, but you can use the Worker on another machine communicating over a fast network to free up resources on the machine running the mining process.\n\n## Note: Using the Lotus Worker from China\n\nIf you are trying to use `lotus-worker` from China. You should set this **environment variable** on your machine:\n\n```sh\nexport IPFS_GATEWAY=\"https://proof-parameters.s3.cn-south-1.jdcloud-oss.com/ipfs/\"\n```\n\n## Get Started\n\nMake sure that the `lotus-worker` is compiled and installed by running:\n\n```sh\nmake lotus-worker\n```\n\n## Setting up the Miner\n\nFirst, you will need to ensure your `lotus-miner`'s API is accessible over the network.\n\nTo do this, open up `~/.lotusminer/config.toml` (Or if you manually set `LOTUS_MINER_PATH`, look under that directory) and look for the API field.\n\nDefault config:\n\n```toml\n[API]\nListenAddress = \"/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/2345/http\"\nRemoteListenAddress = \"127.0.0.1:2345\"\n```\n\nTo make your node accessible over the local area network, you will need to determine your machines IP on the LAN, and change the `127.0.0.1` in the file to that address.\n\nA more permissive and less secure option is to change it to `0.0.0.0`. This will allow anyone who can connect to your computer on that port to access the [API](https://lotu.sh/en+api). They will still need an auth token.\n\n`RemoteListenAddress` must be set to an address which other nodes on your network will be able to reach.\n\nNext, you will need to [create an authentication token](https://lotu.sh/en+api-scripting-support#generate-a-jwt-46). All Lotus APIs require authentication tokens to ensure your processes are as secure against attackers attempting to make unauthenticated requests to them.\n\n### Connect the Lotus Worker\n\nOn the machine that will run `lotus-worker`, set the `MINER_API_INFO` environment variable to `TOKEN:MINER_NODE_MULTIADDR`. Where `TOKEN` is the token we created above, and `NIMER_NODE_MULTIADDR` is the `multiaddr` of the **Lotus Miner** API that was set in `config.toml`.\n\nOnce this is set, run:\n\n```sh\nlotus-worker run\n```\n\nIf you are running multiple workers on the same host, you will need to specify the `--listen` flag and ensure each worker is on a different port.\n\nTo check that the **Lotus Worker** is connected to your **Lotus Miner**, run `lotus-miner sealing workers` and check that the remote worker count has increased.\n\n```sh\nwhy@computer ~/lotus> lotus-miner sealing workers\nWorker 0, host computer\n        CPU:  [                                                                ] 0 core(s) in use\n        RAM:  [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        VMEM: [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        GPU: GeForce RTX 2080, not used\n\nWorker 1, host othercomputer\n        CPU:  [                                                                ] 0 core(s) in use\n        RAM:  [||||||||||||||                                                  ] 23% 14 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        VMEM: [||||||||||||||                                                  ] 23% 14 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        GPU: GeForce RTX 2080, not used\n```\n\n### Running locally for manually managing process priority\n\nYou can also run the **Lotus Worker** on the same machine as your **Lotus Miner**, so you can manually manage the process priority.\nTo do so you have to first __disable all seal task types__ in the miner config.

In this command, `ChainHead` is included as `{ \"method\": \"Filecoin.ChainHead\" }`:\n\n```sh\ncurl -X POST \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     --data '{ \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"Filecoin.ChainHead\", \"params\": [], \"id\": 3 }' \\\n     'http://127.0.0.1:1234/rpc/v0'\n```\n\nIf the request requires authorization, add an authorization header:\n\n```sh\ncurl -X POST \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.lotusminer/token)\" \\\n     --data '{ \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"Filecoin.ChainHead\", \"params\": [], \"id\": 3 }' \\\n     'http://127.0.0.1:1234/rpc/v0'\n```\n\n> In the future we will add a playground to make it easier to build and experiment with API requests.\n\n## CURL authorization\n\nTo authorize your request, you will need to include the **JWT** in a HTTP header, for example:\n\n```sh\n-H \"Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.lotusminer/token)\"\n```\n\nAdmin token is stored in `~/.lotus/token` for the **Lotus Node** or `~/.lotusminer/token` for the **Lotus Miner**.\n\n## How do I generate a token?\n\nTo generate a JWT with custom permissions, use this command:\n\n```sh\n# Lotus Node\nlotus auth create-token --perm admin\n\n# Lotus Miner\nlotus-miner auth create-token --perm admin\n```\n\n## What authorization level should I use?\n\nWhen viewing [api/apistruct/struct.go](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/api/apistruct/struct.go), you will encounter these types:\n\n- `read` - Read node state, no private data.\n- `write` - Write to local store / chain, and `read` permissions.\n- `sign` - Use private keys stored in wallet for signing, `read` and `write` permissions.\n- `admin` - Manage permissions, `read`, `write`, and `sign` permissions.\n","posts":[{"title":"Remote API Support","slug":"en+api-scripting-support","github":"en/api-scripting-support.md","value":"# Remote API Support\n\nYou may want to delegate the work **Lotus Miner** or **Lotus Node** performs to other machines. \nHere is how to setup the necessary authorization and environment variables.\n\n## Environment variables\n\nEnvironmental variables are variables that are defined for the current shell and are inherited by any child shells or processes.

It can also facilitate the creation of new storage deals. If you are not \ninterested in providing your own storage to the network, and do not want to produce blocks\nyourself, then the Lotus Node is all you need!\n\nThe Lotus Miner does everything you need for the registration of storage, and the\nproduction of new blocks. The Lotus Miner communicates with the network by talking \nto a Lotus Node over the JSON-RPC API.\n\n## Setting up a Lotus Node\n\n### How do I set up a Lotus Node?\n\nFollow the instructions found [here](https://lotu.sh/en+getting-started).\n\n### Where can I get the latest version of Lotus?\n\nDownload the binary tagged as the `Latest Release` from the\n [Lotus Github repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases).\n \n### What operating systems can Lotus run on?\n\nLotus can build and run on most Linux and MacOS systems with at least \n8GB of RAM. Windows is not yet supported.\n\n### How can I update to the latest version of Lotus?\n\nTo update Lotus, follow the instructions [here](https://lotu.sh/en+updating-lotus).\n\n### How do I prepare a fresh installation of Lotus?\n\nStop the Lotus daemon, and delete all related files, including sealed and chain data by \nrunning `rm ~/.lotus ~/.lotusminer`.\n\nThen, install Lotus afresh by following the instructions \nfound [here](https://lotu.sh/en+getting-started).\n\n### Can I configure where the node's config and data goes?\n\nYes! The `LOTUS_PATH` variable sets the path for where the Lotus node's data is written.\nThe `LOTUS_MINER_PATH` variable does the same for miner-specific information.\n\n## Interacting with a Lotus Node\n\n### How can I communicate with a Lotus Node?\n\nLotus Nodes have a command-line interface, as well as a JSON-RPC API.\n\n### What are the commands I can send using the command-line interface? \n\nThe command-line interface is self-documenting, try running `lotus --help` from the `lotus` home \ndirectory for more.\n\n### How can I send a request over the JSON-RPC API?\n\nInformation on how to send a `cURL` request to the JSON-RPC API can be found\n[here](https://lotu.sh/en+api). A JavaScript client is under development.\n\n### What are the requests I can send over the JSON-RPC API?\n\nPlease have a look at the \n[source code](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/api/api_full.go) \nfor a list of methods supported by the JSON-RPC API.\n## The Test Network\n\n### What is Testnet?\n\nTestnet is a live network of Lotus Nodes run by the \ncommunity for testing purposes.\n It has 2 PiB of storage (and growing!) dedicated to it.\n\n### Is FIL on the Testnet worth anything?\n\nNothing at all! Real-world incentives may be provided in a future phase of Testnet, but this is \nyet to be confirmed.\n\n### How can I see the status of Testnet?\n\nThe [dashboard](https://stats.testnet.filecoin.io/) displays the status of the network as \nwell as a ton\nof other metrics you might find interesting.\n\n## Mining with a Lotus Node on Testnet\n\n### How do I get started mining with Lotus?\n\nFollow the instructions found [here](https://lotu.sh/en+mining).\n\n### What are the minimum hardware requirements?\n\nAn example test configuration, and minimum hardware requirements can be found \n[here](https://lotu.sh/en+hardware-mining). \n\nNote that these might NOT be the minimum requirements for mining on Mainnet.\n\n### What are some GPUs that have been tested?\n\nA list of benchmarked GPUs can be found [here](https://lotu.sh/en+hardware-mining#benchmarked-gpus-7393).\n\n### Why is my GPU not being used when sealing a sector?\n\nSealing a sector does not involve constant GPU operations. It's possible\nthat your GPU simply isn't necessary at the moment you checked.\n\n## Advanced questions\n\n### Is there a Docker image for lotus?\n\nCommunity-contributed Docker and Docker Compose examples are available \n[here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/tree/master/tools/dockers/docker-examples).\n\n### How can I run two miners on the same machine?\n\nYou can do so by changing the storage path variable for the second miner, e.g.,\n`LOTUS_MINER_PATH=~/.lotusminer2`. You will also need to make sure that no ports collide.\n\n### How do I setup my own local devnet?     \n\nFollow the instructions found [here](https://lotu.sh/en+setup-local-dev-net).\n","posts":[]},{"title":"Glossary","slug":"en+glossary","github":"en/.glossary.json","value":null,"custom":{"glossary":true},"posts":[]}],"glossary":{"bellman":{"title":"Bellman","value":"Bellman is a rust crate for building zk-SNARK circuits.
