There is no guarantee this testing configuration will be suitable for Filecoin storage mining at MainNet launch. If you need to buy new hardware to join the Filecoin Testnet, we recommend to buy no more hardware than you require for testing. To learn more please read this [Protocol Labs Standard Testing Configuration post](https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-testnet-mining/).\n\n**Sector sizes** and **minimum pledged storage** required to mine blocks are two very important Filecoin Testnet parameters that impact hardware decisions. We will continue to refine all parameters during Testnet.\n\nBECAUSE OF THIS, OUR STANDARD TESTING CONFIGURATION FOR FILECOIN MAINNET CAN AND WILL CHANGE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n\n## Example configuration\n\nThe setup below is a minimal example for sealing 32 GiB sectors on Lotus:\n\n- 2 TB of hard drive space.\n- 8 core CPU\n- 128 GiB of RAM\n\nNote that 1GB sectors don't require as high of specs, but are likely to be removed as we improve the performance of 32GB sector sealing.\n\n## Testnet discoveries\n\n- If you only have 128GiB of ram, enabling 256GB of **NVMe** swap on an SSD will help you avoid out-of-memory issues while mining.\n\n## Benchmarked GPUs\n\nGPUs are a must for getting **block rewards**. Here are a few that have been confirmed to generate **SNARKs** quickly enough to successfully mine blocks on the Lotus Testnet.\n\n- GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n- GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\n- GeForce RTX 2080\n- GeForce GTX 1080 Ti\n- GeForce GTX 1080\n- GeForce GTX 1060\n\n## Testing other GPUs\n\nIf you want to test a GPU that is not explicitly supported, use the following global**environment variable**:\n\n```sh\nBELLMAN_CUSTOM_GPU=\"<NAME>:<NUMBER_OF_CORES>\"\n```\n\nHere is an example of trying a GeForce GTX 1660 Ti with 1536 cores.\n\n```sh\nBELLMAN_CUSTOM_GPU=\"GeForce GTX 1660 Ti:1536\"\n```\n\nTo get the number of cores for your GPU, you will need to check your card’s specifications.\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nHere is a [benchmarking tool](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/tree/testnet-staging/cmd/lotus-bench) and a [GitHub issue thread](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/694) for those who wish to experiment with and contribute hardware setups for the **Filecoin Testnet**.\n"}]},{"title":"Setup","slug":"en+getting-started","github":"en/getting-started.md","value":"# Lotus\n\nLotus is an implementation of the **Filecoin Distributed Storage Network**.

This allows you to easily set the process priority of the sealing tasks to be lower than the priority of your more important storage miner process.\n\nTo do this, simply run `lotus-seal-worker run`, and the seal worker will automatically pick up the correct authentication tokens from the `LOTUS_STORAGE_PATH` miner repository.\n\nTo check that the **Lotus Seal Worker** is properly connected to your storage miner, run `lotus-storage-miner info` and check that the remote worker count has increased.\n\n```sh\nwhy@computer ~/lotus> lotus-storage-miner workers list\nWorker 0, host computer\n        CPU:  [                                                                ] 0 core(s) in use\n        RAM:  [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        VMEM: [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        GPU: GeForce RTX 2080, not used\nWorker 1, host computer\n        CPU:  [                                                                ] 0 core(s) in use\n        RAM:  [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        VMEM: [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        GPU: GeForce RTX 2080, not used\n```\n\n## Running Over the Network\n\nWarning: This setup is a little more complex than running it locally.\n\nTo use an entirely separate computer for sealing tasks, you will want to run the `lotus-seal-worker` on a separate machine, connected to your **Lotus Storage Miner** via the local area network.\n\nFirst, you will need to ensure your `lotus-storage-miner`'s API is accessible over the network.\n\nTo do this, open up `~/.lotusstorage/config.toml` (Or if you manually set `LOTUS_STORAGE_PATH`, look under that directory) and look for the API field.\n\nDefault config:\n\n```toml\n[API]\nListenAddress = \"/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/2345/http\"\nRemoteListenAddress = \"127.0.0.1:2345\"\n```\n\nTo make your node accessible over the local area network, you will need to determine your machines IP on the LAN, and change the `127.0.0.1` in the file to that address.\n\nA more permissive and less secure option is to change it to `0.0.0.0`. This will allow anyone who can connect to your computer on that port to access the [API](https://docs.lotu.sh/en+api). They will still need an auth token.\n\n`RemoteListenAddress` must be set to an address which other nodes on your network will be able to reach\n\nNext, you will need to [create an authentication token](https://docs.lotu.sh/en+api-scripting-support#generate-a-jwt-46). All Lotus APIs require authentication tokens to ensure your processes are as secure against attackers attempting to make unauthenticated requests to them.\n\n### Connect the Lotus Seal Worker\n\nOn the machine that will run `lotus-seal-worker`, set the `STORAGE_API_INFO` environment variable to `TOKEN:STORAGE_NODE_MULTIADDR`. Where `TOKEN` is the token we created above, and `STORAGE_NODE_MULTIADDR` is the `multiaddr` of the **Lotus Storage Miner** API that was set in `config.toml`.\n\nOnce this is set, run:\n\n```sh\nlotus-seal-worker run\n```\n\nTo check that the **Lotus Seal Worker** is connected to your **Lotus Storage Miner**, run `lotus-storage-miner workers list` and check that the remote worker count has increased.\n\n```sh\nwhy@computer ~/lotus> lotus-storage-miner workers list\nWorker 0, host computer\n        CPU:  [                                                                ] 0 core(s) in use\n        RAM:  [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        VMEM: [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        GPU: GeForce RTX 2080, not used\n\nWorker 1, host othercomputer\n        CPU:  [                                                                ] 0 core(s) in use\n        RAM:  [||||||||||||||                                                  ] 23% 14 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        VMEM: [||||||||||||||                                                  ] 23% 14 GiB/62.7 GiB\n        GPU: GeForce RTX 2080, not used\n```\n"},{"title":"Static Ports","slug":"en+setting-a-static-port","github":"en/setting-a-static-port.md","value":"# Static Ports\n\nDepending on how your network is set up, you may need to set a static port to successfully connect to peers to perform storage deals with your **Lotus Storage Miner**.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo change the random **swarm port**, you may edit the `config.toml` file located under `$LOTUS_STORAGE_PATH`.

Once you've done that (and set the `BELLMAN_CUSTOM_GPU` as appropriate if necessary) you can verify your GPU is being used by running a quick lotus-bench benchmark.\n\nFirst, to watch GPU utilization run `nvtop` in one terminal, then in a separate terminal, run:\n\n```sh\nlotus-bench --sector-size=2048\n```\n\nThis process uses a fair amount of GPU, and generally takes ~4 minutes to complete. If you do not see any activity in nvtop from lotus during the entire process, it is likely something is misconfigured with your GPU.\n\n## Checking Sync Progress\n\nYou can use this command to check how far behind you are on syncing:\n\n```sh\ndate -d @$(./lotus chain getblock $(./lotus chain head) | jq .Timestamp)\n```\n"}]},{"title":"Storing Data","slug":"en+storing-data","github":"en/storing-data.md","value":"# Storing Data\n\n> There are recent bug reports with these instructions.

It can also facilitate the creation of new storage deals. If you are not \ninterested in providing your own storage to the network, and do not want to produce blocks\nyourself, then the Lotus Node is all you need!\n\nThe Lotus Storage Miner does everything you need for the registration of storage, and the\nproduction of new blocks. The Lotus Storage Miner communicates with the network\nby talking to a Lotus Node over the JSON-RPC API.\n\n## Setting up a Lotus Node\n\n### How do I set up a Lotus Node?\n\nFollow the instructions found [here](https://docs.lotu.sh/en+getting-started).\n\n### Where can I get the latest version of Lotus?\n\nDownload the binary tagged as the `Latest Release` from the\n [Lotus Github repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases).\n \n### What operating systems can Lotus run on?\n\nLotus can build and run on most Linux and MacOS systems with at least \n8GB of RAM. Windows is not yet supported.\n\n### How can I update to the latest version of Lotus?\n\nTo update Lotus, follow the instructions [here](https://lotu.sh/en+updating-lotus).\n\n### How do I prepare a fresh installation of Lotus?\n\nStop the Lotus daemon, and delete all related files, including sealed and chain data by \nrunning `rm ~/.lotus ~/.lotusstorage`.\n\nThen, install Lotus afresh by following the instructions \nfound [here](https://docs.lotu.sh/en+getting-started).\n\n## Interacting with a Lotus Node\n\n### How can I communicate with a Lotus Node?\n\nLotus Nodes have a command-line interface, as well as a JSON-RPC API.\n\n### What are the commands I can send using the command-line interface? \n\nThe command-line interface is self-documenting, try running `lotus --help` from the `lotus` home \ndirectory for more.\n\n### How can I send a request over the JSON-RPC API?\n\nInformation on how to send a `cURL` request to the JSON-RPC API can be found\n[here](https://lotu.sh/en+api). A JavaScript client is under development.\n\n### What are the requests I can send over the JSON-RPC API?\n\nPlease have a look at the \n[source code](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/api/api_common.go) \nfor a list of methods supported by the JSON-RPC API.\n## The Test Network\n\n### What is Testnet?\n\nTestnet is a live network of Lotus Nodes run by the \ncommunity for testing purposes.\n It has 2 PiB of storage (and growing!) dedicated to it.\n\n### Is FIL on the Testnet worth anything?\n\nNothing at all! Real-world incentives may be provided in a future phase of Testnet, but this is \nyet to be confirmed.\n\n### Will there be future phases of Testnet?\n\nYes, there will be at least one more phase of Testnet. We plan on introducing interoperable\n[go-filecoin nodes](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin#filecoin-go-filecoin)\nin a future phase.\n\n### How can I see the status of Testnet?\n\nThe [dashboard](https://stats.testnet.filecoin.io/) displays the status of the network as \nwell as a ton\nof other metrics you might find interesting.\n\n## Mining with a Lotus Node on Testnet\n\n### How do I get started mining with Lotus?\n\nFollow the instructions found [here](https://lotu.sh/en+mining).\n\n### What are the minimum hardware requirements?\n\nAn example test configuration, and minimum hardware requirements can be found \n[here](https://lotu.sh/en+hardware-mining). \n\nNote that these might NOT be the minimum requirements for mining on Mainnet.\n\n### What are some GPUs that have been tested?\n\nA list of benchmarked GPUs can be found [here](https://lotu.sh/en+hardware-mining#benchmarked-gpus-7393).\n\n### Why is my GPU not being used when sealing a sector?\n\nSealing a sector does not involve constant GPU operations. It's possible\nthat your GPU simply isn't necessary at the moment you checked.\n\n## Advanced questions\n\n### Is there a Docker image for lotus?\n\nCommunity-contributed Docker and Docker Compose examples are available \n[here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/tree/master/tools/dockers/docker-examples).\n\n### How can I run two miners on the same machine?\n\nYou can do so by changing the storage path variable for the second miner, e.g.,\n`LOTUS_STORAGE_PATH=~/.lotusstorage2`. You will also need to make sure that no ports collide.\n\n### How do I setup my own local devnet?     \n\nFollow the instructions found [here](https://lotu.sh/en+setup-local-dev-net).","posts":[]},{"title":"Glossary","slug":"en+glossary","github":"en/.glossary.json","value":null,"custom":{"glossary":true},"posts":[]}],"glossary":{"bellman":{"title":"Bellman","value":"Bellman is a rust crate for building zk-SNARK circuits.
